<h3>Officer Usage Suggestions</h3>
<p class="center">
The players, alumni, and recruit pages are meant to be used to keep track of all people associated with the Women's Rugby Team.  You can create, edit, and delete any person, including changing a person's classification type.
As in, once a person graduates, you can click edit and change their person type to alumni, and this will automatically update, moving the person from the player page to the alumni page.  You can also differentiate between active and inactive players.
On each specific person type page, you can click 'Send Email' to open your mail app and send an email to every person listed on that page at once.
Attendance records for each event can be accessed within the events page, and a single person's attendance can be added and edited at one time.  The attendance records allow you to input an excuse note for any reason a player may be absent or late, but the note is not required for functionality.
In the same way as the people, events and attendance records can be created, edited, and deleted at any time.  The transactions function allows you to assign specific merchandise purchases to people, allowing you to see who has purchased which items, how many, and when.

</p>
<h3>Application Maintenance</h3>
<p class="center">
The login allows only the official Women's Rugby team Gmail account to sign in.  We recommend that with each officer change, the password be updated to ensure the fewest people have access to this information as possible.  Additionally, for security purposes, we recommend that you log out after each use session.
